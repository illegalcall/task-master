# Cursor Rules

As a software developer working on Task Master, I will implement tasks one at a time. You, as the reviewer, will evaluate and approve each code change before I proceed to the next task.

- **Atomic Tasks**: Each task should be small, self-contained, and achievable in a short time frame.
- **Testable**: Ensure every task is verifiable with unit tests or manual checks.
- **Independent**: Tasks should be as independent as possible, minimizing cross-dependencies.
- **Incremental Commits**: Only suggest code changes for one task at a time. Wait for review, acceptance, and commit before starting the next task.
- **Clear Output**: Define clear success criteria and expected outputs for each task.
- **Unit Tests Required**: Each task must include unit tests verifying its functionality.
